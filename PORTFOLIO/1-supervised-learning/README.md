the files within this folder contain THEORY regarding the model.
this means scratch implementations and mathematics. then in the problems folder are the classical problems that were shownoff in the `Queen of the hill` subsection.

here I learn my machine learning and become a _scientist_.
the PROBLEMS folder is where I practice my skills and become an ML practioner / engineer.

the methods themselves, within the context of SUPERVISED learning, are usually general-purpose, though at times the assumptions made in one model can be better for a particular problem.
