this folder contains PROJECTS.

PROBLEMS that I have genuienely attempted to solve --- by any means necessary.
i have done analysed the data; i have visualised it, i have trained models on it, i have engineered pipelines and finalised an interpretation of the problem space

it does not contain my own scratch implementations, but rather leverages production quality code and libraries to solve the problems efficiently and correctly.

the problems tend to fall into either the category of **classification**, or **regression**, hence the further subdivision.
