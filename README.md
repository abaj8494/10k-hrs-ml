# 10,000 Hours of Machine Learning.

> "S/he who has a why, can bear almost any how." - Friedrich Nietzche

I've fallen in love with machine learning.
I'm going to spend 10,000 hours of **deliberate practise** on the subject, and construct the appropriate feedback loops.

Here is what I have done / what I intend to do:
- [X] UNSW AI
- [X] UNSW Machine Learning and Data Mining
- [ ] UNSW Deep Learning and Neural Networks
- [ ] UNSW Computer Vision
- [ ] Stanford CS229 (Machine Learning)
- [ ] Stanford CS230 (Deep Learning)
- [ ] Mathematics for Machine Learning
- [ ] HOML (Hands on Machine Learning)
